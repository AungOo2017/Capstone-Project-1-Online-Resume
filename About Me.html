        <p>
            Inspired by the captivating worlds of Hollywood animation movies and the immersive experiences of various famous online games, my career goal is to become an animator in the film or game industry. My passion is to craft content that captivates and connects with people everywhere.

        <p>As a computer graphics technology major at a senior level at Purdue, I have transferred from Ivy Tech College to further deepen my expertise in this field. My experience as a photographer has honed my visual storytelling skills and eye for composition, which I am now eager to translate into the realm of animation.
