        <p>
            I have many hobbies. Photography is one of them, and I also enjoy drawing and design. In my free time, I love watching movies. Every evening, I go running and sometimes hike. During long holidays, I like to travel to different states to see new scenery. Besides that, I spend time programming and learning new languages.
